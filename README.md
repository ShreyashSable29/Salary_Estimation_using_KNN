# Salary_Estimation_using_KNN
This project is build for checking or predicting the Salary of the Employess in an organisation weather he/she is eligible to get the amount of salary or not on the basic of some features or other data.

## Introduction
Most of companies problems are resignation’s of salaries, one of the major cause of resignations that they are not comfort on the place that they are working in, either the team they are working with, or the employees that they are having there offices in the same department, an idea comes in mind why not classifying people using KNN, so we can get the best place to work for our salaries, How is that ? Here we will clarify how this classification is working.

- We’ll see how can we use K Nearest Neighbor Algorithm to help us in this labour-intensive task.
- Here’s a general overview of what we will do:
- Getting a data set about relationships between people with different characteristics .
- Calculating distances between 2 salaries depending on a table of distances that is generated from the training data set.
- Use the classifier to classify a new salary into the right department.

- K-Nearest Neighbour is one of the simplest Machine Learning algorithms based on Supervised Learning technique.
- K-NN algorithm assumes the similarity between the new case/data and available cases and put the new case into the category that is most similar to the available categories.
- K-NN algorithm stores all the available data and classifies a new data point based on the similarity. This means when new data appears then it can be easily classified into a well suite category by using K- NN algorithm.
- K-NN algorithm can be used for Regression as well as for Classification but mostly it is used for the Classification problems.
- K-NN is a non-parametric algorithm, which means it does not make any assumption on underlying data.
- It is also called a lazy learner algorithm because it does not learn from the training set immediately instead it stores the dataset and at the time of classification, it performs an action on the dataset.
- KNN algorithm at the training phase just stores the dataset and when it gets new data, then it classifies that data into a category that is much similar to the new data.

## The dataSet used in this project is sorted or cleaned dataset on which the Feature Scaling is done.
## The DataSet file is attached or uploaded above.
